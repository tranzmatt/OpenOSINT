## [2.20.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Bright Data integration** — two new optional tools backed by the [Bright Data](https://get.brightdata.com/984ni58s2oad) API. Both tools require `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY` and gracefully degrade (descriptive error string, no exception) when the key is absent. Free tier: 5,000 requests/month.
  - `search_dorks_live` — executes the same Google dork templates as `generate_dorks` through the Bright Data SERP API, returning structured results (title, URL, snippet) for each query. Runs up to 5 dorks by default; each is a separate billable call. `generate_dorks` is unchanged and remains fully offline.
  - `scrape_url` — fetches any public URL through the Bright Data Web Unlocker API (bypasses Cloudflare/CAPTCHA) and returns clean Markdown via the API's native `data_format: "markdown"` conversion. A general primitive the AI agent can chain after other tools.
- Both tools are wired into all four interfaces: **REPL** (agent tool-use), **CLI** (`openosint search-dorks-live <target>`, `openosint scrape <url>`), **MCP server** (`search_dorks_live`, `scrape_url` tools), and **Web UI** (tool catalog with availability indicator).
- New env vars: `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY`, `BRIGHTDATA_SERP_ZONE`, `BRIGHTDATA_UNLOCKER_ZONE` — added to `.env.example` and README Configuration table.
- Unit tests (`tests/test_brightdata.py`): success, failure, and missing-key cases for both tools, all HTTP calls mocked.

---

## [2.19.1] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- Use absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs for logo and terminal demo images so they render correctly on the PyPI project page (PyPI's renderer does not resolve relative paths).

---

## [2.19.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible backend** (`--provider openai`). OpenOSINT can now drive any
  endpoint that speaks the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` protocol — LiteLLM,
  llama-swap, vLLM, LM Studio, etc. — via the new `OpenAICompatibleAgent`.
  - CLI flags: `--openai-base-url`, `--openai-model`, `--openai-api-key`.
  - Env vars: `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`. When
    `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is set (and no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), it takes precedence
    over Ollama.
  - Web UI: new "OpenAI API" backend option with base-URL/model/key fields and a
    connection test; streaming tool-use via the new `_stream_openai` handler.
  - The target model must support tool/function calling (for llama.cpp behind
    llama-swap, launch with `--jinja`).
  - 68 unit tests covering all new code paths (100% on `OpenAICompatibleAgent`,
    `_select_chat_backend`, `_stream_openai`, and CLI/REPL routing).

### Fixed
- `OpenAICompatibleAgent`: empty `choices` server response now returns a descriptive
  error instead of a bare `"list index out of range"` exception.

## [2.18.1] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Fix: resolve binaries installed in the same venv/uv-tool bin so co-installed tools
  (`holehe`, `phoneinfoga`, `sherlock`, `sublist3r`) are found instead of throwing a spurious
  `ToolNotFoundError`. `run_subprocess()` now prepends the running interpreter's `bin/` directory
  to `PATH` before exec. Fix by [@consocio](https://github.com/consocio) ([#6](https://github.com/OpenOSINT/OpenOSINT/pull/6)).

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.18.1.

---

## [2.15.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **DNS intelligence** (`openosint/tools/search_dns.py`): new tool `search_dns` that performs
  comprehensive DNS record enumeration (A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME, SOA) using dnspython.
  Automatically highlights email security misconfigurations: absent or permissive SPF policy,
  missing or unenforced DMARC, absent DKIM records across common selectors. No external API
  or credentials required. Available as CLI subcommand `openosint dns DOMAIN [-t SECONDS]`,
  in the AI agent tool loop, and as an MCP tool.
- **GitHub OSINT** (`openosint/tools/search_github.py`): new tool `search_github` that queries
  the GitHub REST API for a username, email, or keyword. For direct username matches returns
  full profile data (bio, location, company, follower counts, public repos/gists), the most
  recently updated repositories with language and star counts, and email addresses discovered
  from public commit history. For other queries returns the top 5 matching user accounts.
  Optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable raises the unauthenticated rate limit from
  60 to 5000 requests per hour. Available as CLI subcommand `openosint github QUERY [-t SECONDS]`,
  in the AI agent tool loop, and as an MCP tool.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.15.0.
- `dnspython>=2.6.0` added to core dependencies.
- Agent SYSTEM_PROMPT updated: domain investigations now suggest `search_dns` alongside
  `search_whois` and `search_domain`; GitHub username lookups use `search_github`.
- MCP server docstring updated to reflect 16 tools.
- README: tools table, CLI synopsis, and FILES section updated.

---

## [2.14.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- **AbuseIPDB integration** (`openosint/tools/search_abuseipdb.py`): new tool
  `search_abuseipdb` that checks an IP address against the AbuseIPDB v2 API.
  Returns abuse confidence score (0–100%), total reports, country, ISP, domain,
  and last reported timestamp. Displays a prominent ⚠️ HIGH ABUSE CONFIDENCE
  warning when score exceeds 50%. Validates IPv4/IPv6 input before calling the
  API; returns a descriptive error string for invalid input or missing credentials.
  Requires `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` environment variable. Available as CLI subcommand
  `openosint abuseipdb IP_ADDRESS [-t SECONDS]`, in the AI agent tool loop, and
  as an MCP tool.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.14.0 in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, MCP server docstring.
- `aiohttp>=3.9.0` added to core dependencies.

---

## [2.13.0] — 2026-05-21

### Changed

- Bumped version to 2.13.0

---

## [2.12.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- Web interface (`openosint web`) — browser-based AI chat UI
- Light/dark theme toggle in web UI
- Ollama support in web UI for local inference
- Demo recording script (`python media/record_demo.py`)
- Web demo GIF and MP4

### Changed

- README: added web interface demo at top, restructured header with tagline and centered layout
- Docs: added demo section with web and CLI demos side by side

---

## [2.11.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- **IP2Location integration** (`openosint/tools/search_ip2location.py`): new tool `search_ip2location` that queries the IP2Location.io API for enhanced IP intelligence. Returns geolocation (country, region, city, lat/lon, ZIP), ISP, domain, ASN, and security flags: VPN, proxy, Tor exit node, and datacenter hosting. Adds a prominent `⚠️  FLAGGED: VPN/Proxy/Tor detected` warning line when any flag is active. Validates IPv4 and IPv6 input with regex before calling the API; returns `"Invalid IP address format."` for non-IP strings. Requires `IP2LOCATION_API_KEY` environment variable; returns a descriptive error string if absent. Available as CLI subcommand `openosint ip2location IP_ADDRESS [-t SECONDS]`, in the AI agent tool loop, and as an MCP tool. Sponsored integration.
- **.env file support** (`python-dotenv`): `openosint/cli.py` now calls `load_dotenv()` at startup so users can store API keys in a `.env` file at the project root instead of exporting environment variables manually. `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` added to core dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
- **.env.example template**: new `.env.example` file at the project root documents all supported environment variables with placeholder values. Copy to `.env` and fill in keys.

### Changed

- `.gitignore`: added `!.env.example` so the example template is tracked while `.env` and `*.env.*` remain excluded.
- README: tools table, optional env vars, and Integrations section updated to include `search_ip2location` and `IP2LOCATION_API_KEY`. Sponsored note added for IP2Location.

### Chore

- Version bumped to `2.10.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, MCP server docstring.

---

## [2.9.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Censys integration** (`openosint/tools/search_censys.py`): new tool `search_censys` that queries the Censys Search API for internet-facing infrastructure data. Auto-detects input type: IPv4 address → `CensysHosts().view()` returning open ports, services, ASN, and country; domain → `CensysCerts().search()` with `parsed.names` filter returning certificate count, issuer, SANs, and first/last seen dates. Returns descriptive error strings for missing credentials, rate limits, and network errors. Requires `CENSYS_API_ID` and `CENSYS_SECRET` environment variables. Available as CLI subcommand `openosint censys TARGET [-t SECONDS]`, in the AI agent tool loop, and as an MCP tool.
- **Auto-detection of IP vs domain for Censys queries**: IPv4 pattern → host view; everything else → certificate search.

### Changed

- Version bumped to `2.9.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, MCP server docstring.
- Agent `SYSTEM_PROMPT` updated to mention `search_censys` for IP and domain infrastructure investigations.
- README: tools table, optional env vars, optional packages, FILES section, and CLI synopsis updated to include `search_censys`.
- `pyproject.toml`: added `censys>=2.2.0` as optional dependency under `[project.optional-dependencies]` `censys` and `all` extras.

### Docs

- Updated `README.md` tools table and env vars with `search_censys`, `CENSYS_API_ID`, `CENSYS_SECRET`.
- Added Integrations table to `README.md`.

---

## [2.8.0] — 2026-05-17

### Refactor

- Full clean code pass across the entire codebase: consistent naming conventions (`is_/has_/can_` booleans, verb-prefixed functions, no abbreviations), extracted module-level constants, split functions exceeding 20 lines into focused helpers, added type hints to every public signature.
- Extracted shared subprocess execution logic into `openosint/utils.py` (`run_subprocess`, `SubprocessResult`) — eliminates duplication across four tool modules.
- `agent.py`: extracted `_AgentRunContext` dataclass, `_extract_first_text`, `_execute_tool`, `_process_tool_turn`, `_process_ollama_tool_turn`, and `_build_ollama_assistant_message` helpers; `_MAX_TOKENS = 4096` constant; both agent `run()` methods reduced to ≤25 lines.
- `pdf_report.py`: split `_generate_pdf_sync` (~100 lines) into `_build_pdf_styles`, `_build_pdf_story`, `_create_footer_callback`.
- `search_whois.py`: synchronous WHOIS call now wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for` + `run_in_executor` for real timeout support; `timeout_seconds` parameter added to `run_whois_osint`.
- All tools: explicit `timeout_seconds` propagated through agent `_TOOL_MAP` and MCP `_HANDLERS`.
- `repl.py`, `cli.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `multi_target.py`: `no_pdf` → `is_pdf_disabled`; `parallel` → `is_parallel`; silent `except Exception: pass` blocks replaced with `logger.debug(..., exc_info=True)`.

### Chore

- All health checks passing: ruff, pytest (99+ tests), pip check, bandit.
- Version bumped to `2.8.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, banner, MCP server docstring.
- `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "function"` added to `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`.

---

## [2.7.0] — 2026-05-16

### Added

- **VirusTotal integration** (`openosint/tools/search_virustotal.py`): new tool `search_virustotal` that checks IP addresses, domains, URLs, and file hashes (MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256) against VirusTotal's 70+ antivirus engines using the VirusTotal API v3. Auto-detects input type and calls the appropriate endpoint (`/ip_addresses`, `/domains`, `/urls` + `/analyses` polling, `/files`). Returns country, ASN, registrar, file type, analysis stats (malicious/suspicious/harmless/undetected votes), and a prominent warning line when `malicious > 0`. Requires `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` environment variable; returns a descriptive error string if absent. Available as CLI subcommand `openosint virustotal TARGET [-t SECONDS]`, in the AI agent tool loop, and as an MCP tool.
- **Auto-detection of input type for VirusTotal queries**: IPv4 pattern → IP lookup, `^[0-9a-fA-F]{32|40|64}$` → file hash lookup, `http(s)://` prefix → URL scan (submit + poll), everything else → domain lookup.

### Changed

- Version bumped to `2.7.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`.

### Chore

- `pyproject.toml` description updated to reflect 11 tools.

---

## [2.6.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added

- **Persistent session history** (`openosint/session_history.py`): each REPL session is automatically saved to `~/.openosint/history/<timestamp>_session.json` when the session ends (normal exit, Ctrl-D, or crash). Each file records the timestamp, duration, prompts typed, tools used, targets investigated, and report path — no raw tool output or API keys are ever stored. At most 50 sessions are retained; the oldest file is deleted when the limit is exceeded.
- **`openosint history` CLI command**: lists the last 10 sessions in a Rich table (columns: #, date, duration, targets, tools used, report). Supports `--all` to show all sessions, `--last N` to show the last N, `openosint history open N` to view the full session JSON plus report contents in a Rich panel, and `openosint history clear` to delete all history with a confirmation prompt.
- **Session count hint in REPL banner**: if saved sessions exist, a one-line hint is shown at startup — `💾 N sessions saved — type 'history' to browse`. The `history` REPL command displays the last 10 sessions inline.

### Changed

- Version bumped to `2.6.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and REPL banner.

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Star prompt in REPL banner**: the welcome banner now prints a one-time star prompt to stderr — `⭐ If OpenOSINT is useful, star it → https://github.com/OpenOSINT/OpenOSINT` — using Rich with a yellow star emoji and dim URL. Printed to stderr only; never appears in CLI subcommand output or MCP server responses.

### Changed

- Version bumped to `2.5.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and REPL banner.

### Chore

- Removed AI model attribution from contributor metadata so only the human author appears in the GitHub contributor graph.

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Shodan integration** (`openosint/tools/search_shodan.py`): new tool `search_shodan` that performs host lookups (`api.host()`) for IP addresses or keyword banner searches (`api.search()`) for any other query. Requires `SHODAN_API_KEY` environment variable; returns a descriptive error string if absent. Available as CLI subcommand `openosint shodan QUERY [-t SECONDS]`, in the AI agent tool loop, and as an MCP tool.
- **Ollama support** (`--provider ollama`): the AI agent loop now works with local Ollama models — no Anthropic API key required. Use `--provider ollama` (default: `llama3.2`), `--ollama-model MODEL`, and `--ollama-host URL`. The `OllamaAgent` in `agent.py` follows the same tool-use loop as the Anthropic agent: tool call → execute real binary → feed real output back → repeat until done. Requires `pip install ollama` (optional dependency).
- **PDF report export** (`openosint/pdf_report.py`): every investigation that auto-saves a Markdown report now also generates a matching PDF (`reports/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_report.pdf`) using `reportlab`. The PDF includes a branded header, clean body text with monospace tool output sections, and a footer with page numbers. Generation is non-blocking (runs in a thread executor). Use `--no-pdf` to disable. Falls back silently with a log warning if `reportlab` is not installed.
- **Multi-target investigation** (`openosint/multi_target.py`): new `openosint multi TARGETS` CLI subcommand and `investigate_multi` MCP tool. Accepts a comma-separated list of targets or a path to a file with one target per line. All targets are investigated in parallel via `asyncio.gather()`. Each gets its own report file (`reports/YYYY-MM-DD_target_report.md`); a consolidated summary is written to `reports/YYYY-MM-DD_summary.md`. Maximum 10 targets per run.
- **New CLI flags**: `--provider`, `--ollama-model`, `--ollama-host`, `--no-pdf`.
- **REPL**: banner now shows the active provider and model. `config` command shows provider, Ollama host, and PDF status.
- **Test suite** (`tests/test_v240.py`): tests covering missing Shodan API key, IP detection helper, multi-target 10-target limit, target parsing from files and inline strings, and PDF file creation.

### Changed

- Version bumped to `2.4.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, REPL banner, and MCP server header.
- Agent tool definitions and `_TOOL_MAP` updated to include `search_shodan`.
- `[project.optional-dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml` now includes `shodan`, `ollama`, `pdf`, and `all` extras.

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Parallel tool execution** (`--parallel` CLI flag): independent complementary tools now run concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`. For the `email` subcommand, `search_email` and `search_breach` execute in parallel. For the `username` subcommand, `search_username` and `search_paste` execute in parallel. Sequential execution remains the default for backward compatibility.
- **JSON export** (`--json` CLI flag): all direct CLI commands can now output results as structured JSON instead of formatted text. Each result follows a consistent schema: `{ "tool", "target", "timestamp", "results", "error" }`.
- **MCP JSON output parameter**: each MCP tool now accepts an optional `json_output` boolean parameter. When `true`, the tool response is returned in the same structured JSON schema used by the CLI.
- **`openosint/json_output.py`**: new internal module exposing `format_tool_result()` and `to_json()` helpers, importable by both CLI and MCP server.
- **Docker support**: added `Dockerfile` (based on `python:3.12-slim`) and `docker-compose.yml` to the repository root. The image installs `holehe`, `sherlock-project`, and `sublist3r` via pip, and mounts `./reports/` as a volume.
- **Test suite** (`tests/test_json_export.py`): pytest tests covering the JSON export schema for all 9 tool names, line splitting, blank-line filtering, error field handling, and ISO-8601 timestamp format.

### Changed

- Version bumped to `2.3.0` in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `repl.py` banner, `mcp_server.py` header, and `search_breach.py` user-agent string.
- CLI status/progress messages now go to `stderr` so that `--json` stdout output is clean and pipeable.

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- Project documentation website (`docs/`) with landing page, logo, sitemap, and robots.txt.
- `docs/CNAME` for custom domain support on GitHub Pages.

### Changed

- README rewritten in man-page style with full per-tool documentation, architecture table, and example output blocks.
- `index.html` iteration with improved layout and copy.

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- Interactive REPL (`openosint/repl.py`) powered by `prompt_toolkit` and `Rich` — the default mode when running `openosint` with no arguments.
- Auto-save: structured reports with a `##` header longer than 300 characters are automatically written to `reports/<timestamp>_report.md`.
- REPL built-in commands: `clear`, `save`, `tools`, `config`, `help`, `exit`.
- `search_paste` tool: searches Pastebin dumps via psbdmp.ws API.
- `search_phone` tool: wraps the `phoneinfoga` binary for carrier and country intelligence.
- `generate_dorks` tool: generates 12 targeted Google dork URLs locally (no network calls).
- Agent system prompt with explicit investigation strategy and chaining rules.
- `openosint/exceptions.py`: shared exception hierarchy (`OSINTError`, `ToolNotFoundError`, `ToolExecutionError`, `ToolTimeoutError`).
- MCP server (`openosint/mcp_server.py`) exposing all 9 tools to Claude Code and Claude Desktop.

### Changed

- Model updated to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`.
- All tool modules return descriptive error strings on failure rather than raising — callers (CLI, MCP, agent) never need to catch tool-level exceptions.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

- Initial public release of OpenOSINT v2.
- Core tool set: `search_email` (holehe), `search_username` (sherlock), `search_breach` (HIBP v3 API), `search_whois` (python-whois), `search_ip` (ipinfo.io), `search_domain` (sublist3r).
- AI agent loop (`openosint/agent.py`) using the Anthropic native tool use API.
- Direct CLI subcommands: `email`, `username`.
- `pyproject.toml` PEP 621 build configuration with `openosint` entry point.
- MIT license.
